# bookbot
boot.dev bookbot project repo

BookBot is my first [BootDev](boot.dev) project!

**Completed:** Feb 11, 2025

- Built to be completely functional with any .txt files
- Learned how to reference a buffer variable by calling the .txt file name via `f.buffer.name`. See `main.py` for more context on implementation.

**Learning opportunities:**

1. Don't be afraid to search for answers / leads to solutions. 
    a. Had implemented an alphabet variable at first containing all lowercase letters of the alphabet to check if the current character is a letter. Could just use `.isalpha()` instead.
2. Leverage as many functions as needed, and maintain their focus. Avoid logic existing in `main()`, and instead focus on calling functions instead.
